# Unhandled JSON Key Errors in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in asynchronous Dart code involving network requests and JSON parsing. The original code lacks robust error handling for situations where the expected keys are missing from the JSON response.  This can lead to runtime exceptions and application crashes.

The `bug.dart` file contains the original code with the error. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug Description

The `fetchData` function makes an HTTP request. While it checks the HTTP status code, it doesn't handle the case where the JSON response may be missing a key that the code attempts to access. This can cause a runtime error.

## Solution

The solution involves adding checks to ensure the existence of keys before attempting to access them.  This prevents the runtime error caused by missing keys.
